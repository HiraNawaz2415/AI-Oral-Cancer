## Techniques used for diagnosis of oral cancer:
3.1. Physical examination:
Doctors first check the mouth and nearby areas by looking and feeling for any unusual changes.
They note lumps, swelling, color changes, or pain in areas like the lips, glands, and mouth to detect early signs of oral cancer.
3.2. Histopathological examination:
Doctors study tissue under a microscope to check cell changes, growth, and structure to confirm cancer.
This helps detect how much the cells have become abnormal or invasive in oral cancer.

3.3. Vital staining techniques:
Dyes like toluidine blue and Lugol’s iodine are used to color abnormal mouth tissues for easy detection.
They are simple, cheap, and helpful for early screening of oral cancer, especially in developing countries.

3.4. Biopsy:
A small piece of tissue is taken from a suspected area and examined under a microscope.
It is the most reliable way to confirm the presence of oral cancer.

3.4.1. Brush biopsy:
Cells are gently scraped from the mouth using a brush and checked for cancer signs.
It’s painless, low-cost, and can even be used with digital tools for remote diagnosis.

3.4.2. Exfoliative cytology:
Loose cells from mouth surfaces are collected and analyzed for abnormal features.
It’s a simple, non-invasive test used for early screening and monitoring of mouth lesions.

3.4.3. Incisional biopsy:
A small part of the suspicious tissue is surgically removed for detailed lab testing.
It helps diagnose when full removal isn’t possible and gives accurate results.

3.5. Imaging techniques:
Scans like MRI, CT, and PET are used to view internal structures and detect tumor spread.
These help doctors plan treatment and understand how far the cancer has grown.

3.5.1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):
MRI shows clear soft tissue details and helps see tumor size and spread in the mouth.
It’s useful for checking deep tissue invasion before treatment.

3.5.2. Computed tomography (CT):
CT uses X-rays and computers to locate tumors in the mouth and neck.
It’s affordable and common, but small early tumors may not always show up clearly.

3.5.3. Positron emission tomography (PET):
PET uses a radioactive dye to find cancer spread, especially in lymph nodes.
It helps in staging and detecting hidden cancerous areas.

3.6. Optical and radiological techniques:
X-rays, ultrasound, and optical imaging help detect how far cancer has spread.
New tools like laser and spectral imaging can identify early malignant changes in tissues.

3.7. Biomarker detection and biosensors:
Certain proteins, genes, or molecules in saliva or blood act as cancer markers.
Modern biosensors detect these markers or exosomes for fast, non-invasive oral cancer diagnosis.
