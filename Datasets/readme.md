This dataset is designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of machine learning models for the classification of oral cancer images versus normal oral tissue images. It contains a total of 1,238 high-quality images, comprising 553 images of normal oral tissue and 685 images of oral cancer lesions. The dataset is curated to support binary classification tasks, enabling researchers and data scientists to build and test algorithms for early detection and diagnosis of oral cancer.
